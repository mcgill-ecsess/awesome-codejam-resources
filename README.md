# üèñ CodeJam 2018 Resources

This document contains a bunch of resources for CodeJam 2018. Feel free to look through and get yourself adjusted to the content before the hackathon.

## üë∂ Basics

If this is your first time at a hackathon or coding past ECSE 202 or COMP 202, it's probably best that you learn some concepts that'll help ramp you up before!

- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Interactive tutorial to learn Git, the most popular version control system for collaborative programming.
- [What's an API?](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82) - Learn how to use external services in your projects.
- [A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to HTTP and REST](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-http-and-rest--net-16340) - A more in-depth guide on how to use REST APIs.
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - An in-depth series of tutorials to learn how to code in Python. If you don't know what language to use, Python is a good start!
- [Roadmap to Fullstack Web Development](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/the-2018-roadmap-to-fullstack-web-development-8884ff02557a) - Web projects are some of the easiest to make during a hackathon. Learn more about different technologies that are commonly used!
- [Google Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro) - If you want to ramp up quick on machine learning.
- [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) - A beginner-friendly prediction competition.

## üõ† Recommended Software

These are some recommended tools for general hackathon success:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Your favorite programmer's favorite text editor.
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - Easy-to-use Git GUI interface so you don't need to use the command line.
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) - REST API testing tool.

## üèé Boilerplates

Boilerplate code is your best friend for a hackathon! As these are time-limited events, you don't want to spend half your time setting up your project.

Here are a few examples:

- [Mega Boilerplate](https://github.com/sahat/megaboilerplate)
- [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate)
- [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter)

If these don't suit your usecase, feel free to look up other boilerplates online!

## üìö Useful Libraries and Frameworks

Here are a few libraries that might prove to be useful during the competition! If the official library isn't written in your favorite language, try finding wrappers/bindings for it online!

## üî¢ Data Set Resources

Without data, how are you going to recognize patterns? Here are some resources you can use to quickly find data sets!

- [Australian Government Data](https://data.gov.au/dataset)
- [Google Data Set Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [GIS Datasets](https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/)
- [Open NYC Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)

If you want to avoid training your own models, you can also find pretrained models online!

- [Model Zoo](https://modelzoo.co/)
- [Model Depot](https://modeldepot.io/)

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is especially useful when you need to do heavy computations (read: Machine Learning). There are a few providers. If this is your first time using them, they usually provide a bunch of free credits for students.

- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/)
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/)
- [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/machine-learning)
