# üèñ CodeJam 2018 Resources

This document contains a bunch of resources for CodeJam 2018. Feel free to look through and get yourself adjusted to the content before the hackathon.

## üë∂ Basics

If this is your first time at a hackathon or coding past ECSE 202 or COMP 202, it's probably best that you learn some concepts that'll help ramp you up before!

- [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Interactive tutorial to learn Git, the most popular version control system for collaborative programming.

## üõ† Recommended Software

These are some recommended tools for general hackathon success:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Your favorite programmer's favorite text editor.
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) - Easy-to-use Git GUI interface so you don't need to use the command line.

- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) - REST API testing tool.

## üèé Boilerplates

Boilerplate code is your best friend for a hackathon! As these are time-limited events, you don't want to spend half your time setting up your project.

Here are a few examples:

- [Mega Boilerplate](https://github.com/sahat/megaboilerplate)
- [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter)
- [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate)

If these don't suit your usecase, feel free to look up other boilerplates online!
